## Robot Operating System

ROS (Robot Operating System) is chosen for its versatility, open-source nature, and extensive support in the robotics. It provides a middleware framework that facilitates communication between different components of a robotic system. ROS messages that represent the data structure for exchanging information between the robot and the simulation model. For this example, we'll include information from proximity sensors, position sensors, and temperature sensors.

In the robot code, configure the robot to publish data to the defined ROS topic. This can be done using ROS publishers.In the simulation model code, configure the simulation model to subscribe to the same ROS topic. This can be done using ROS subscribers.

## Achieving a Real-Time System:

# Possibilities:

ROS provides a publish-subscribe model that facilitates asynchronous communication, enabling near-real-time data exchange.

## Challenges:

Latency:

Achieving true real-time performance might be challenging due to factors such as network latency, processing time, and the ROS middleware itself.Optimize the communication and processing speed to minimize latency.

Synchronization:

Ensure proper synchronization between the robot and simulation model. ROS handles some aspects of synchronization, but you need to be mindful of potential delays.

## Changes Needed:

## ROS Integration:

Implement the ROS code in both the robot and simulation model.

## Message Definitions:

Create appropriate ROS message definitions for the data we want to exchange.

## ROS Package Configuration:

Organize the code into ROS packages and configure them accordingly.
