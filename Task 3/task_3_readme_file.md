## # Paper Folding Simulation Model

## Overview
This simulation model uses SimPy to simulate a paper folding process in a workstation, involving operators, robots, and various stages such as paper loading, alignment verification, folding, and quality checking.

## Paper Folding Process

### 1. Paper Loading
- **Operator Action:** The operator initiates the process by loading a paper into the robot.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation tracks the time it takes for the operator to load the paper into the robot.

### 2. Paper Loading Verification
- **Operator Action:** The operator checks the loaded paper for any loading errors.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation records the time taken for the operator to verify the paper loading.

### 3. Paper Alignment Verification
- **Operator Action:** The operator checks the alignment of the paper.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation records the time taken for the operator to verify paper alignment.

### 4. Folding Operation
- **Robot Action:** The robot initiates the folding process.
- **Operator Action:** The operator may assist in certain folding steps.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation tracks the time taken for the robot and operator during the folding process.

### 5. Quality Check
- **Operator Action:** The operator checks the folded paper for quality.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation records the time taken for the operator to perform the quality check.

### 6. Handover to Next Station
- **Robot Action:** The robot hands over the folded paper to the next station (Workstation2).
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation logs the time of handover.

### 7. Operator Idle Time and Robot Return
- **Operator Action:** The operator may be idle during various stages.Those times are recorded for our results.
- **Robot Action:** The robot returns to the start position after completing the process.
- **Simulation Step:** The simulation records the idle time of the operator and the time taken for the robot to return.

## Execution Example
```python
# Import necessary modules and classes
import simpy
from your_simulation_file import WorkStation1, Operator, Robot, Paper, paper_generator

# Create a SimPy environment
env = simpy.Environment()

# Initialize simulation components
paper_list = []
folded_papers = 0
operator = Operator(env, WorkStation1, folded_papers)
workstation1 = WorkStation1(env, paper_list, Robot, Workstation2, Operator, folded_papers)

# Run the simulation
print("Simulation started...")
env.process(paper_generator(env, workstation1, paper_list))
env.run(until=28800)  
print("Simulation completed.")

# Display simulation results
print("The number of produced papers is " + str(workstation1.folded_papers - 1) + ".")
print("The simulation duration is " + str(env.now) + " seconds.")

# Calculate and display average processing times, defective papers, and generate visualizations
print ("The average process time of the produced papers is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_process_time))

print ("The average Folding process time is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_folding1_time))
print ("The average Quality check time is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_quality_check_time))
print ("The average paper loading verification time is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_paper_loading_verification_time))
print ("The average paper alignment verification time is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_paper_alignment_verification_time))
print ("The number of defective papers is "+str(workstation1.defective_papers)+".")
print ("The average operator idle time is {:.2f} seconds.".format(average_operator_idle_time))

## The simulation provides information about the folding process of paper, such as the number of papers produced, average processing times, defective papers, and visualizations for betterÂ analysis.
